Many folks find it very complicated to learn, which is a side-effect of being able to do anything with it. This comes installed with Anaconda's Python distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) is a \"wrapper\" or simplification of other GUI frameworks. It does a lot of the complicated stuff for you. As a result, it doesn't do *everything* for you. (You can still access the specific objects of the underlying complicated framework if needed.) Building a GUI that can do a lot of things--but not everything--is probably fine for most people."

    "You can run the simplest TkInter program by running the next code cell below. Note two things:\n",

    "1. When you do, the `In [ ]:` to the left of the cell should show an asterisk, as in `In [*]:`. That is Jupyter-speak for \"this cell is still running\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What's running is a new window. Check your task bar. On Windows, it shows up as a white piece of paper icon. If you click that, the TkInter window should appear. It's just an empty grey box. Close it in the usual way you close a window. At that point, the `In [*]` should show a number, indicating that code is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'so what' of those two points is that when you run code that opens a GUI, that code keeps running as long as the window exists. This is the *event loop* defined earlier. So, you can't open a GUI, then run more code in your notebook and expect the GUI to be updated in real-time. You need to close the GUI window, edit your code, then re-run it to restart the GUI.\n",
